# Mercury2 HWM Primary Configuration File
#
# This file contains the configuration options that control how the Mercury2 hardware manager operates. All available
# configuration options are listed below, along with their default values and any specific instructions. If any required
# options are left unspecified, the HWM will reject the configuration and exit.
#
# The hardware device and pipeline configurations are in the 'devices.yml' and 'pipelines.yml' configuration files,
# respectively. 
#
# Important Note: All local resource locations defined in this configuration file (e.g. ssl-private-key-location and 
#                 schedule-location-local) can either be absolute or relative (to the user running the HWM). If a local
#                 resource location is left unspecified in this configuration file, a default value will be used that 
#                 points to a file in the default Mercury2 configuration directory. All user provided non-default values
#                 are assumed to be absolute or relative to the HWM user directory (i.e. not relative to the
#                 configuration directory).
#
# See the provided documentation for a complete overview of the Mercury2 HWM configuration system.

# station-name: A human-readable name used to represent this HWM installation in the user interface and elsewhere.
#               Because the HWM instance is identified by the TLS certificate provided by the user interface, this can
#               be changed without needing to worry about if the UI will still recognize the ground station.
#
# Required: True
station-name: "Mercury2 Ground Station"

# station-longitude: The longitude of the ground station that is running this HWM instance. This is needed to correctly
#                    calibrate some location dependent scripts like the orbital propagator. Note that this is an 
#                    east-west longitude (with negative being west and positive being east).
#
# Required: True
station-longitude: -125.753765

# station-latitude: The latitude of the ground station that is running this HWM instance. This is needed to correctly
#                   calibrate some location dependent scripts like the orbital propagator.
#
# Required: True
station-latitude: 39.031859

# station-altitude: The altitude of the ground station above sea level in meters. This is needed to correctly calibrate
#                   some location dependent scripts like the orbital propagator.
#
# Required: True
station-altitude: 22

# offline-mode: This option lets you specify if the ground station will be operated in offline mode. Offline mode
#               indicates that the computer running this HWM instance will routinely not have access to the user
#               interface API and should load its schedule and permission settings from a local location instead of 
#               querying the UI.
#
#offline-mode: false

# network-command-port: What port the station command socket should operate on. All commands from the network should be
#                       sent to this port.
#
#network-command-port: 8080

# mercury2-ui-location: The location of the Mercury2 User Interface. If the station is being operated in online mode,
#                       it will fetch its schedule and user permissions from this UI installation. This should just be
#                       the base URL with no trailing slash.
#
# Required: True
mercury2-ui-location: "http://localhost/mercury2"

# ssl-private-key-location: The local location of the TLS private key that was generated for this HWM instance by the 
#                           user interface.
#
#ssl-private-key-location: "{HWM Configuration Directory}/ssl/mercury2_hwm-key.pem"

# ssl-public-cert-location: The local location of the TLS public certificate that was generated for this HWM instance by
#                           the user interface.
#
#ssl-public-cert-location: "{HWM Configuration Directory}/ssl/mercury2_hwm-cert.pem"

# ssl-ca-cert-location: The local location of the TLS certificate authority certificate provided by the user interface. 
#                       This file is used to verify that incomming command and telemetry connections are from a user 
#                       known to the user interface.
#
#ssl-ca-cert-location: "{HWM Configuration Directory}/ssl/ca-cert.pem"

# schedule-update-period: Defines how frequently (in seconds) the reservation schedule should be updated.
#
#schedule-update-period: 30

# schedule-update-timeout: The timeout duration (in seconds) that should be used when loading the reservation schedule.
#
#schedule-update-timeout: 10

# schedule-location-local: The local location of the reservation schedule for this ground station. This will only be
#                          used if the ground station is in offline mode.
#
#schedule-location-local: "{HWM Configuration Directory}/schedules/offline_schedule.json"

# schedule-location-network: The user interface API endpoint that will be used to load this station's reservation
#                            schedule. It will be appended to the mercury2-ui-location. Note that it does not include
#                            a prefixed slash.
#
#schedule-location-network: "test_schedule.json"

# permissions-update-timeout: The timeout duration (in seconds) that should be used when loading user permissions.
#
#permissions-update-timeout: 10

# permissions-location-local: The local location of the user permissions file. This will only be used if the ground
#                             ground station is in offline mode.
#
#permissions-location-local: "{HWM Configuration Directory}/permissions/offline_permissions.json"

# permissions-location-network: The user interface API endpoint that will be used to load user ground station access
#                               permissions.
#
#permissions-location-network: "test_permissions.json"
