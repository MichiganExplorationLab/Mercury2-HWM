This script is used to generate schedules for the Mercury2 hardware manager. 

It uses the fetchTLE API to load the pass schedule for the specified satellite and ground station and generates a 
schedule file for those passes. This script will eventually be replaced by the Mercury2 user interface, which will be 
much more user-friendly.
