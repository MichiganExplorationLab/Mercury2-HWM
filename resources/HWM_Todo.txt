- Antenna controller updates
  - Test automatic state update (fix C2 command)
  - Handle flip passes
  - Reduce connection error log spam
- Flatten /var/local/ folder structure
- Update logging:
  - Log all commands and arguments, client connections, permission & schedule file updates
- Design less verbose command permission system
- Add state methods to the SGP4 propagator and balloon tracker
- Design pipeline data stream consumer & producer setup
  - Limit memory usage
  - Log all data passing through the pipeline and automatically purge old data
- Make driver state available to rest of pipeline (query-ably by device type) instead of state services (TNC)
- Write high level documentation
  - Installation instructions, virtual env, etc.
- Update command parameter meta-data to use JSON schema
  - Validate parameters on command submit
- Write state collection unit tests
- Write state collection class/methods
  - Update devices to log errors to device state
  - Add state collecting LoopingCall to pipelines (for collecting automatic pipeline telemetry)
  - Add state reporting methods to the session coordinator
  - Register events from various sources
    - Failed session cleanup, driver errors, etc.
  - Device state reported live via telemetry stream during session and every few minutes via post to server (for admin forms, gs overview, etc.).
- Use SSL encryption/authentication for all HWM-UI interactions
  - Schedule and permission connections
- Move test drivers to more appropriate location
- Move device output checks to pipeline from driver
- Fix unit test data file paths when not in develop mode

Other:
- Research circular dependency issues
- Add more error checks for commands, event sequences, and function calls that break state
- Separate session and reservation concepts to allow for non-reservation based sessions
  - Separate "reservation" concept from the session coordinator
- Convert some device, pipeline, and session class attributes to "private"
- Update _init_.py files to clean up import paths
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5831148/why-would-i-put-python-code-in-init-py-files
- Update Pipeline._set_active_services to not interact with session attributes directly
- Pipeline data stream 'filters' or 'hooks'
  - E.g. extract GPS coordinates from data stream and offer to the pipeline via a service
  - Allows drivers to be extended without modifying driver file, keeps drivers and data processing separate, reduces driver dependencies 
- Isolate frequently used configuration options
